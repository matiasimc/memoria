abstract="Access control is the process of mediating every request to resources and data maintained by a system and determining whether the request should be granted or denied. The access control decision is enforced by a mechanism implementing regulations established by a security policy. Different access control policies can be applied, corresponding to different criteria for defining what should, and what should not, be allowed, and, in some sense, to different definitions of what ensuring security means. In this chapter we investigate the basic concepts behind access control design and enforcement, and point out different security requirements that may need to be taken into consideration. We discuss several access control policies, and models formalizing them, that have been proposed in the literature or that are currently under investigation.",

abstract="This paper addresses the problem of checking programs written in an object-oriented language to ensure that they satisfy the information flow policies, confidentiality and integrity. Policy is specified using security types. An algorithm that infers such security types in a modular manner is presented. The specification of the algorithm involves inference for libraries. Library classes and methods maybe parameterized by security levels. It is shown how modular inference is achieved in the presence of method inheritance and override. Soundness and completeness theorems for the inference algorithm are given.",

We model control-flow side channels with a program counter transcript, in which the value of the program counter at each step is leaked to an adversary. The program counter transcript model captures a class of side channel attacks that includes timing attacks and error disclosure attacks.",

pages="667--686",
abstract="Since record polymorphism is one of essential factors for object-oriented languages, various approaches to incorporate record polymorphism into type systems have been proposed to lay the foundation for object-oriented languages. Recursive types, which are essentially types of lists or trees, are major programming tools. In object-oriented languages, a pseudo variable ``self'' has a recursive type, which requires that type systems be able to treat recursive types. The purpose of this paper is to provide a type system and its type inference algorithm which can handle subtyping, recursive types and parametric polymorphism without any kind of type declaration or unnatural restrictions. We prove soundness and completeness of the type inference algorithm. Our system integrates subtyping and recursive types into Damas and Milner's type system and preserves important properties such as existence of principal typing. The basic idea is that we consider a type as a regular tree.",
