pages="84--99",
abstract="This paper addresses the problem of checking programs written in an object-oriented language to ensure that they satisfy the information flow policies, confidentiality and integrity. Policy is specified using security types. An algorithm that infers such security types in a modular manner is presented. The specification of the algorithm involves inference for libraries. Library classes and methods maybe parameterized by security levels. It is shown how modular inference is achieved in the presence of method inheritance and override. Soundness and completeness theorems for the inference algorithm are given.",

abstract="We introduce new methods for detecting control-flow side channel attacks, transforming C source code to eliminate such attacks, and checking that the transformed code is free of control-flow side channels. We model control-flow side channels with a program counter transcript, in which the value of the program counter at each step is leaked to an adversary. The program counter transcript model captures a class of side channel attacks that includes timing attacks and error disclosure attacks.",
